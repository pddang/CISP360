# Payroll-App
Overview: 
The application produced a report including gross pay, regular hours, overtime hours,
federal taxes, statetaxes, SSI taxes, net pay through the employee data file: employees.dat, employeesinfo.dat, and zipcode.dat.

The quicksort algorithm is implemented to sort all the employees alphabetically by their last name.        
The application will also provide the summary reports of the total and averages of inputs and 
outputs for all employees processed. 

The program resembles the layout of a paystub.


How to run the code:

*In the Windows/Mac environment: 
-In main.cpp, change the directory to the location in which you save the file, otherwise error will appear: "File open failed..Terminating"


*In the Linux environment:
-In main.cpp, change directory to \ and add the root directory to the code. For example: payroll\employee.dat.
